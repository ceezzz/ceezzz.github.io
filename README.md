            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> Hello my name is Cesar Jaimes and I've recently decided to dable in github once again. The project plan here is to start a portfolio of past and present projects I've been working on. I am currently working as a Software Developer II for Element Logic. We specialize in warehouse automation and my primary work revolves around SQL Server. I started this job knowing very little SQL knowledge. It has been challenging but very rewarding learning what can be done. I've done things from creating new stored procedures to working with our legacy software from the early 2000's that many of our clients still use today. Follow along if you wish as I will be listing projects that I have worked on to track and see the growth in this journey.</p>
